This repository contains example Python code demonstrating basic programming concepts including variables, data structures, and logical operators.

Contents
1. Basic Variables
Demonstrates variable assignment with different data types:

python
PLP = "Academy"
Student_name = "Mwikali Sharon"
Student_ID = 1001  # integer
Student_Age = 21   # integer
Fees_clearance = True  # boolean
2. Lists
Shows list creation and usage:

python
languages = ["Python", "Java", "C++", "Javascript"]
shopping_list = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Butter"]
3. Tuples
Demonstrates immutable tuples:

python
products = ('XBox', 499.99, 'Habibi', 23)
4. Sets
Illustrates set operations including union, intersection, and difference:

python
Set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set_B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
5. Dictionaries
Shows dictionary structure for key-value pairs:

python
student_info = {
    'Name': 'Mwikali Sharon',
    'ID': '1001',
    'Age': '20.2',
    'Fees clearance': 'True'
}
6. Logical Operators
Demonstrates AND, OR, and NOT operations:

python
print(a < b and b > c)  # AND
print(a < b or b > c)   # OR
print(not (a < b))      # NOT
